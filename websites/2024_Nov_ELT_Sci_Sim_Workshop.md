# ELT Science + Simulations Workshop #1
# “First-Light”
## Vienna University, Nov 27-29
A hybrid meeting for kick-starting feasibility studies of the main ELT science cases in preparation for first-light

## Why another ELT meeting?
- What do we want to see with the ELT?
- What can the ELT see?
- How can we get time to see with the ELT?
- And if we cannot see with the ELT? When then?

The ELT is nominally four years away, or 1.33 PhD’s away. Time is ticking for us to start thinking about how to get our hands on ELT data and how to write proposals that the ELT TAC will accept. Each instrument consortium is already working on these topics internally, but are we, as a community, working on this, too?

This will be the first in a series of five annual meetings financed by the Austrian Academy of Science. The aim is to bring together the future ELT community to help build the science cases and proposals that will shape the initial observing periods once the ELT enters operations.

## Meeting format
This three-day hybrid meeting aims to transform the numerous discussions on first-light ELT science topics into simulated observations that can be used to justify observing time in the earliest stages of ELT.

To achieve this the meeting will complement the traditional presentation sessions with an “observation simulation hackathon”

Each 90-minute hackathon session will focus on generating “ScopeSim-ready” toy models (in Python) for simulating observations of the science cases presented in the previous 90-minute science session.

By integrating science with simulations, we hope to provide the community with a useful tool for preparing watertight proposals for the initial round of ELT observations.

## Goals of the Meeting
- Raise awareness of the main ELT science cases for the first light instruments MICADO and METIS through a series of presentations (5x 1.5hr sessions)
- Foster collaboration on science feasibility studies
- Kick-start observation simulations to underscore feasibility studies using the common observation simulator software (ScopeSim).
- Create a collection of “toy models” for expected ELT targets in an open-source repository for use by others in the astronomical community.

## Registration
The meeting will be limited to a maximum of 25 participants.

The deadline for regular registration is the **1st of November**.

If you would like to apply for subsidised hotel costs the registration deadline is **18th of October**
