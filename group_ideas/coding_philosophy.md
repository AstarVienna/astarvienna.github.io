### Zen of ELT-Group
Based on the zen of python - `>>> import this`

    praise in public, criticise in private
    functions should not be longer than your screen
    if it's not green, don't push it
    docstrings are not optional
    branches stay open for maximum a week
    the master branch is not a playground
    self-approval is never as fun as approval by a partner
    you know everything
    everyone else knows nothing
    ideas are for sharing
    no code is sacred

    Do you use source control?
    Can you make a build in one step?
    Do you make daily builds?
    Do you have a bug database?
    Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
    Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
    Do you have a spec?
    Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
    Do you use the best tools money can buy?
    Do you have testers?
    Do new candidates write code during their interview?
    Do you do hallway usability testing?
